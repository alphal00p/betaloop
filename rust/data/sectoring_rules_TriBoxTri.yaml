# The cut ordering is as follows:
# | ID   (cut edges   ) : E-surf ID
# | #0   (-0|+1       ) : #21
# | #1   (-2|+3       ) : #10
# | #2   (-0|+4|+6    ) : #19
# | #3   (+1|-4|-5    ) : #22
# | #4   (+6|-7|-2    ) : #17
# | #5   (+3|+7|-5    ) : #11
# | #6   (-0|+4|+7|+3 ) : #15
# | #7   (+1|-4|-7|-2 ) : #23
# | #8   (-5|+6       ) : #18
# And the loop momenta indices conventions are k=0 (left), m=1 (middle), l=2 (right)
# If a CT belongs to a sector and cut not matching any rule below, the default behaviour will be applied
# Convention for the signature of each cut:
# -2: absent from cFF term OR inactive
# -1: absent from cFF term
#  0: present in cFF term but inactive cut (selected away by observable)
#  1: present in cFF term and active cut (selected by the observable)
